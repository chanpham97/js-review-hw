// Task 1: Create variable called 'storeName' and set it to "CSH Store". Console log "Welcome to [storeName]"


// Task 2: Create a user object with properties 'username' (any), 'password' (any), and 'status' (online or offline). 


// Task 3: Console log "[username] is [status]".


// Task 4: Prompt the user to enter their password and save it in a variable called passwordGuess


// Task 5: If passwordGuess is equal to the password, console log "Welcome [username]" and change status to "online". Else, console log "Wrong password" and change status to "offline"


// Task 6: Create an object called hoodieInventory with the properties 'name' ("hoodie"), 'quantity' (any number), and 'price' (any number). 


// Task 7: Console log "[name] costs [price]"


// Task 8: You just sold a hoodie! Change the quantity to be smaller. Console log "[quantity] [name] left in inventory." Confirm that the number changed!


// Extra credit: Change task 5 such that if the user guesses the password wrong, it keeps prompting them until they guess correctly!
